		<section id="use_case">
As a SAP admin I want to migrate organizations to Workday instance.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating organizations from SAP instance to Workday one, being able to match organizations by Integration ID. 

As implemented, this Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Process and On Complete stages.

During the Input stage the Template will go to the SAP system and query all the existing Organizations that match the filtering criteria.
The last step of the Process stage will insert or update organizations in Workday, added under a specified organization in the Workday organization hierarchy.

Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.</section>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**
Before using this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer
This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.

In any of the ways you would like to run this Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

{
    "Message": "Batch Process initiated",
    "ID": "e9354ac0-a9ec-11e8-ae2c-2ac63fa6f77a",
    "RecordCount": 3,
    "StartExecutionOn": "2018-08-27T13:32:42Z"
}

Fill in all the properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties](../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.
After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/migrateorganizations` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sapwdayorganizationmigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sapwdayorganizationmigration.cloudhub.io/migrateorganizations` and report will be sent to the email configured.

This is the file where you will find the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only an [HTTP Listener Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

**HTTP Listener Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateorganizations` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Organizations synced and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). which handles all the logic of it.
