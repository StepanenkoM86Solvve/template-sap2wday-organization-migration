As a SAP admin I want to migrate organizations to Workday instance.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating organizations from SAP instance to Workday one, being able to match organizations by Integration ID. 

As implemented, this Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.

During the Input stage the Template will go to the SAP system and query all the existing Organizations that match the filtering criteria.
The last step of the Process stage will insert or update organizations in Workday, added under a specified organization in the Workday organization hierarchy.

Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.</section>

This is the file where you will find the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateorganizations` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Organizations synced and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
